# Audit Roles and Responsibilities
For an impartial assessment the audit and assessment roles must be defined in a manner that:
* ensures a separation of concerns
* reduces and/or eliminates the potential for conflict of interest
* utilizes the proper expertise in the appropriate areas
* ensures impartiality
* reduces and/or eliminates bias
* maintains consistency

While a clear definiton of roles and responsbilities remains paramount, sight should never be lost of the importance of teamwork, collaboration and knowledge-sharing. If efforts are focused too much on separation and siloes, the holistic view might be lost along with individual and collective perspectives and insights that could strenghten the overall process.

Please note that the terms audit/assessment and auditors/assessors are considered equivalent and may be used interchangebly
