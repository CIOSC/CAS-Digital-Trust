# Assurance Scheme
## Object of Verification
Confirmation of an organization’s claim of conformity to National Standard of Canada, CAN/CIOSC 103-1, Digital Trust and Identity – Part 1: Fundamentals through the provision of objective evidence, that the specified requirements in CAN/CIOSC 103-1 have been fulfilled. 

## Assurance Engagement
An assurance engagement is an engagement in which an independent practitioner performs procedures with an aim to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence in order to express a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other than the responsible party about the outcome of the measurement or evaluation of an underlying subject matter against criteria.  

Using the Canadian Standards for Assurance Engagement (e.g. CSAE 3000 and CSAE 3001) published in the CPA Canada Handbook – Assurance, a practitioner can undertake an assurance engagement on a variety of subject matters. For example, management of an entity may request a practitioner to express an opinion on management’s evaluation of whether the entity’s system/tool/process meets the requirements of a specific CIOSC standard.  The CIOSC Standard forms the criteria against which management evaluates the entity’s system/tool/process.  

## Type of Assurance Engagments and Reports

“Reasonable” assurance vs. “Limited” assurance 

A practitioner can provide two levels of assurance engagements – a reasonable assurance engagement (in some cases referred to as an “audit”) and a limited assurance engagement (in some cases referred to as a “review”).  Determining the level of assurance is a choice based upon the extent of assurance an entity requires or prefers. The key difference between the two types of assurance is the evidence obtained and the type of opinion expressed. The suitability of the criteria is not contingent on the level of assurance.  

The Table below illustrates the key differences between the two levels of assurance engagements. 
||Reasonable Assurance|Limited Assurance|
|---|---|---|
|Criteria|The suitability of criteria is not contingent on the level of assurance. If criteria are not suitable for a reasonable assurance engagement, they would also not be suitable for a limited assurance engagement. |
