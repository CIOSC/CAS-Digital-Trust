## Description of activity 
### Quality System Incidents 
For the purposes of this document a “Quality System Incident” is defined as complaints, suggestions, observations and opportunities for improvement. Quality System Incident data is entered into the Corrective Action System for proper treatment (QP04). This procedure describes the methodology for collecting and processing incident reports; and communicates the impact to staff. 

CIOSC recognizes that incidents occur in daily operation that collectively have an impact on the Quality Management System. In order to properly analyze and address system issues a consistent and thorough process for collection of information is critical.     

### Complaints 

Complaints are incidents of grievance or dissatsifaction with CIOSC’s certification service. Complaints may be: 

* internal in nature: raised by a CIOSC staff or contractors with regards to internal service, operations or employee/contractor performance
* external in nature: raised by CIOSC members, clients, suppliers or any other external party
* in writing 
* verbal
* raised by client’s customers or stakeholders 

### Terminology used for incidents 

Incidents and complaints are considered as one of the following four matters: 

<b>Suggestions </b>

CIOSC recognizes that positive feedback is as important as negative. Suggestions are helpful in identifying risk and system improvement. As with complaints, suggestions may be internal or external in nature, written or verbal. 

<b>Appeals</b> 

CIOSC recognizes that clients may have some reservations	or may not agree with the conduct of auditors, audit findings, certification committee decisions and / or overall interaction with CIOSC staff/contractors. A client is free to communicate the same to the CIOSC Appeals Subcommittee and as an appeal from the client.  

<b>Observations</b> 

Observations are witnessed incidents of service or operational deficiencies, malfunction and/or failures. Observations are often made by individuals independent of the activity witnessed and therefore objective in nature. Observations play an important role in identification of risk and system improvement. 
 
<b>Opportunities for Improvement</b> 

Opportunites for Improvement are incidents where the system has not failed, but greater operational effectiveness or efficiency may be obtained in analyzing current practice. Opportunites for Improvement are often collected internally, but input from external sources is also beneficial. 

### Receipt of Incidents  

The quality incident report may be received by any means – verbal or written. When a quality incident is received from an external source, the incident report may be received by any staff member. The staff member shall complete the Incident Report recording all the information and details of the complaint. The completed Incident Report shall be submitted to Quality Manager for further action. When a quality incident is received from an internal source, the incident report shall be completed by the staff member having received the quality incident and submitted to the Quality Manager. 

The Quality Manager shall contact (i.e., telephone, email, letter) the external source to acknowledge receipt of information within 5 working days. They shall understand the issue in detail from the source (to avoid any error in documenting the incident). They may decide to personally meet with the external source, depending on the gravity and seriousness of issue. 

In cases of complaints and observations, it may be against CIOSC (i.e., a system, procedure, or a person) or a CIOSC certified organization (client). For suggestions and opportunity for improvement, it is for CIOSC to study the suggestion/opportunity and decide on their appropriate treatment. 

All such incidents received by any means or by anyone shall be first recorded in the Incident Report form with the following details: 

* Incident type 
* Date received 
* Mode of receipt; 
* Received by; 
* Name of client / other party; and
* Description of issue, complaint and/or appeal. 

Incident Reports are submitted to the Quality Manager for root cause analysis. 

The Quality Manager validates the complaint after checking necessary back-up records and interviews of auditors / staff members / contractors (who were involved in the activity in question), as applicable. 

### Handling of Client Complaint and Observations 

In the case of a complaint / observation against CIOSC, the Quality Manager analyses the issue to determine if there is system error or person error. They shall determine the root cause and determine corrective action. Possible complaints include: 

* Administration: problems with appointments, certification files, and certificates issued or issued late; 
* Auditor / Subcontractor: problems with incomplete audit or surveillance documentation; and 
* Agents: problems with general compliance with CIOSC administration or audit procedures. 

The correction is initiated immediately to satisfy the complainant. This may include training / counseling the person involved. The corrective and preventive action is discussed with management during next Management Review. Appropriate action is taken based on discussions (e.g., change in procedure / forms, training to all personnel). An email is sent out to all staff detailing the issue and remedial action (for information). A copy of the complaint and investigation details is maintained in the respective individual’s personnel file for reference at the performance appraisals. 

When a complaint / observation is against a certified client, the Quality Manager studies the complaint and discusses with the auditor (last audit). If the complaint is found genuine and valid, i.e., indicates a system failure, the complaint is sent to the client for a response. No confidential reports or information shall be sent to complainants without written permission from the client. Adequate time is given to the client for response. If required, the Quality Manager follows up with the client for the response. Depending on the response, the Quality Manager may decide to: 

Write to the complainant about the response and asks for his response; 

Asks for further clarification from the client; 

Depute an auditor to personally visit the client and investigate for system failure. Such visit shall be considered as special visit and charged to the client; or 

Request a joint meeting with client, complainant and CIOSC. 

 

The Quality Manager shall communicate with the complainant at the end of the process detailing the findings and to formally close the complaint. A copy of the correspondence is kept in the client file for records and the same is passed to the auditor during next audit. The details of all complaints and action taken are discussed in Management Review and Impartiality Committee meeting. 

### Handling of Appeals 

Any company or organisation who fails to satisfy an audit or surveillance may appeal against the decision. Where an appeal is received the following steps shall be followed: 

* The Executive Director shall appoint the members of the appeals committee under the leadership of Executive Director who will hear the appeal and determine the outcome. The Executive Director is independent and not part of audit / certification teams. The decision on the appeal shall be taken based on the decision by the Impartiality Committee. Results of the appeal shall be reported to the Certification Board. 

* All appeals shall be received by the Executive Director and details of appeals shall be recorded in the Appeals Register maintained by the Executive Director. 

* The Executive Director shall investigate the appeal made and inform the client about its plan of action for investigation and resolution. 

* An investigation report (i.e., Incident Report) for each individual appeal shall be maintained by the Executive Director. In cases where any further corrective action is required post actions identified and taken based on Incident Report, the Corrective Action Procedure (QP04) shall be performed. 

* A copy of the investigation report shall be sent to the client.
* In cases of any ambiguity, the same shall be reviewed by the Impartiality Committee for decision. 
* In cases where issues remain open; the same shall be provided to the accreditation board for its valuable comments. 
* All appeals made are collated and analyzed on a yearly basis by the Executive Director. 
* Necessary corrective actions shall be taken based on the appeal trend. 
* Appeal trends and corrective action taken shall be reviewed as part of the Management Committee meeting and Impartiality Committee meeting. 
* The Executive Director shall ensure that details with respect to the appellant and actions taken are not shared with the audit team members.
* The Executive Director shall ensure that no discriminatory action is taken against the appellant. 
* The client shall be made aware of the appeals process and that the process is available to them on request. 

In cases of an appeal made by a client against a decision made by auditor, the Lead Auditor, or Certification Committee, the appeal shall be recorded by Executive Director and forwarded to Appeal Subcommittee. The Appeal Subcommittee shall review the appeal, investigate (which may include discussion with concerned client, respective auditor / lead auditor and review of audit report). The Appeal Subcommittee may also direct any other lead auditor to visit the site and determine the validity of the appeal. The decision taken by Appeal Subcommittee shall be communicated to the client and to Executive Director for necessary action. The case is also discussed during the next Management Review meeting and Impartiality Committee meeting. In special cases, the case may be discussed with Impartiality Committee members on one-to-one basis. 
 
### Handling of Suggestions and Opportunity for Improvement 

The concerned staff or stakeholder shall submit a completed incident report to the Quality manager.  

The Quality Manager studies the suggestion or opportunity for improvement to determine any conflict with ISO/IEC 17021 requirements or CIOSC policies. In cases where a suggestion is in conflict, the same is communicated to the initiator. The suggestion shall be discussed in Management review. In cases where the suggestion is found not to be in conflict, the suggestion is studied for benefits and the impact on other processes. 

The suggestion is accepted if found beneficial and does not adversely impact any other process. The Quality Manager determines the changes to existing documentation and implements through the Document Change process (QP01).  

The Quality Manager is responsible for forwarding the appeal and complaints handling process upon request by any certified client or interested party. They shall also inform a certified client and any other interested party of the appeals and complaint handling process if any complaints or appeals are received by certified clients or interested party. 


### Closing of complaints and appeals 

Depending on the nature of the non-conformity, the Quality Manager or Executive Director may follow up with requests for corrective actions. When the investigation of client complaint and appeal determines that remote operation or other external organizations contributed to the complaint and appeal, the Executive Director contacts these organizations and provides them with all relevant information. 

Every client complaint and appeal shall be recorded. The records are maintained by the Quality Manager and Executive Director. When there are copies of written communication, reports and other documents related to a complaint and appeal, these records are organized into a file and are identified with the complaint and appeal number and with records of the corresponding corrective action. The records of investigations that concern product quality or other test characteristics are maintained by Director, Verification and Assessments. Based on the analysis of client or other party complaint and appeal, necessary actions are taken, and the client/party is contacted to close the complaint and appeal. The Quality Manager identifies need for taking corrective action to prevent such complaint and appeal in future and accordingly concerned persons are informed. 

 All complaint and appeal received by CIOSC will be closed within 7 working days after receipt of the complaint and appeal. The Executive Director is authorised for closing of complaint and appeal.
