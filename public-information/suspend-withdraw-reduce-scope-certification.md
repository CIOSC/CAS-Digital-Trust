**Stage 1** includes administrative review. The submitted set of documents is reviewed for completion (also called administrative review) by AE. Audit report review checklist (F34) is used to record the review. AE issues a deviation note against the team leader (F35 Deviation note) if he finds one while administration review.

The audit report (corrected if possible) along with audit report review checklist (F34) is submitted to Certification committee member for technical review which includes review of the information provided by the audit team is sufficient with respect to certification requirements, scope of accreditation and effectiveness of corrections and corrective actions are effective for all non-conformances raised during the audit. Stage 2 shall be carried out by the auditor qualified for the specific sector, provided he has not participated in the audit and has not declared any conflict w.r.t. the client. The person responsible for technical review is identified during the contract review (F085). It is the responsibility of the auditor to pro-actively declare of any conflict. The technical review may lead to a deviation note (F35), which is issued against the team leader, if a deviation is found. All auditors are trained for the review process. In cases where technical expert is used for the audit, the technical reviewer may discuss with the technical expert on the NC / observations used. The reviewer may also discuss any particular part of the report with the team leader / specific auditor. The reviewer also identifies if correction to deviation note (F35) issued needs to be completed prior to Stage 3.

Correspondence related to the client ( e.g. Complaints received against the client, changes in scope, media reports etc) are also reviewed during recertification decision.  The decision taken is recorded on F34 form. For stage 1 audit, the stage 2 audit may be planned after technical review, however the certification committee chairman shall review the stage 1 audit report along with stage 2 audit before making a decision. The certification committee may ask for specific inputs from the client or send any auditor to the client to verify any part of the report. 

In case Certification committee chairman is involved in the audit or is not available or has declared conflict w.r.t. any client, any other director reviews the audit report and takes the decision. The change is recorded on F34 form.

Also refer to any specific instructions given by Quality Manager w.r.t. expiry dates e.g. during transition to revised standard, the expiry of old standard may be pre-decided by the accreditation board. 

* The initial registration date shall be the issue date for first 3 year cycle. In the triennial case, the initial registration date shall be the issue date of first certificate issued. The certificate number shall continue to be the same. The scope shall be the same as in earlier certificate. 

* In case the client goes for second cycle but not as triennial (i.e. a gap between expiry of first cycle and second initial date), the certificate shall be considered as fresh and initial registration date shall be the same as issue date. The earlier certificate shall not be considered. A new certificate number shall be awarded. 

* On each certificate to be issued, fill in the client organization's name, base office, address, standard (including issue year of standard), and scope, based on the information on the audit report. Be sure to check for any changes indicated on Comment Sheets included in the audit report.

* In cases of group of companies, the locations may have different scopes of certification or trading names, each is issued with respective names, addresses and scope. The certificate shall have the same certificate number with a suffix (as explained above).

* In the event of issuing any revised certification documents, then the original certificate number will have a suffix of revision number. e.g. I/001/07 – R1, for first revision. The expiry date of the certificate does not change and continues the same as the original. Issue date shall be the date of C.C. Chairman Approval.

Unless a reply is received to the letter accompanying notification within 14 days, certification will be suspended and a notification of suspension may be published at the discretion of CIOSC 

The client's response to the accompanying letter will be reviewed and the proceedings may be put on hold while clarification is sought. 

Where mutually agreed-upon corrective action is to be implemented, a time period for implementation will be specified and a review of the corrective action undertaken at the appointed time. This may be the subject of a special surveillance visit or of review of submitted objective evidence, at the discretion of CIOSC Should the corrective action not be considered adequate or not be completed by the appointed time, certification will be automatically suspended. 

In the case of serious circumstances, CIOSC may invoke suspension during the period pending the implementation of corrective action. 

Where suspension has been invoked, unless otherwise specified, the client must advise CIOSC every 14 days of the current situation of corrective action. Failure to meet this requirement will result in cancellation of the client's certification. 

Where suspension has been invoked due to failure to conduct surveillance audit, the client shall give justification for failure and offer suitable date. An additional day shall be added to routine surveillance days. The date shall not be later than 15 months from last audit. Failure to offer for audit within 15 months shall result in cancellation of certification. 

When corrective action to resolve the problem(s) taken by the client has been verified, certification will be resumed. The period of certification will not be revised to cover the period of suspension. 

Cancellation of certification will be invoked where, following suspension of certification, the client fails to respond to CIOSC communications within the 14-day grace period or fails to implement corrective action within the appointed time period. 

In extreme circumstances CIOSC may invoke the cancellation of certification with immediate effect without recourse to initial certification suspension. 

Cancellation of certification will require the client to assume the status of non-approval and return all certification documentation to CIOSC
