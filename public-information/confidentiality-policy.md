# Confidentiality Policy

All information received by or available to CIO Strategy Council staff, subcontractors, or committee members (in whatever format) in conducting audit activities, or during other certification activities, or during any engagements with an organization for any other reason shall be regarded as strictly confidential and shall not be divulged to any third party (unless specified in ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015) without the express permission of the organization or individual concerned. The requirement to keep confidential any information will also include any organization that has a legitimate right to audit or inspect CIO Strategy Council.  

Where CIO Strategy Council is required by law to release confidential information to a third party, the client or individual concerned shall, unless regulated by law, be notified in advance of the information provided  

Where an organization is seen to be operating contrary to legal requirements or has operating practices which pose a danger to staff, customers or the environment, CIO Strategy Council reserves the right to immediately report any such incident to the relevant authority. Any such reporting will only be undertaken with the permission of the Executive Director. 

All records are retained in a secure manner, only accessible to authorised staff and password controlled. Subcontractors are limited to accessing information produced by them in conducting an audit. Records are only made available to organizations who can demonstrate a legitimate (and legal) right to view those records and specifically to Accreditation Bodies, e.g., Standards Council of Canada. 

All staff, subcontractors, directors, and Impartiality Committee members are required to agree to the CIO Strategy Council confidentiality policy and sign a confidentiality agreement. Subcontractors are required to sign an agreement which also contains the responsibility to maintain confidentiality.
